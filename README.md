This project is a Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to control the mouse cursor and perform actions like clicking through simple hand gestures captured via a webcam. By leveraging computer vision and hand-tracking techniques, the system provides a touchless, intuitive, and futuristic way to interact with a computer. The project uses MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection and PyAutoGUI for controlling the cursor on screen. It runs smoothly on Python 3.10 with the required dependencies installed. This application demonstrates how AI and gesture recognition can be integrated into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to create innovative and practical solutions.
